# Personal DSML Projects

Welcome to my personal repository where I share various Data Science and Machine Learning projects. This repository contains a collection of work ranging from data analysis, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization, to deep learning models and their applications.

## Projects Overview

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a different project, and each project is self-contained with necessary code, data (if applicable), and documentation.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras (for deep learning projects)
- SQL (for database-related projects)
